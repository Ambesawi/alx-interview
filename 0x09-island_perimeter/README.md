## Task
### 0. Island Perimeter
Create a function `def island_perimeter(grid):` that returns the perimeter of the island described in `grid`:

- `grid` is a list of list of integers:
  - 0 represents water
  - 1 represents land
- Each cell is square, with a side length of 1
- Cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
- `grid` is rectangular, with its width and height not exceeding 100
- The grid is completely surrounded by water
- There is only one island (or nothing).
- The island doesn’t have "lakes" (water inside that isn’t connected to the water surrounding the island).

## Example Usage
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""
0-main
"""
island_perimeter = __import__('0-island_perimeter').island_perimeter

if __name__ == "__main__":
    grid = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]
    print(island_perimeter(grid))
