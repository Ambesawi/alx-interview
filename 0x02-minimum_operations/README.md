This is a Python program that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to generate 'n' 'H' characters in a text file, using only two operations: Copy All and Paste.

## Requirements

- Python 3.4.3
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All files should be executable
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`

## Usage

You can run the program by executing the `0-main.py` script as shown in the example below:

```bash
$ ./0-main.py
